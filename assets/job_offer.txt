Job Title: Creative Technologist
Location: San Francisco, California

Overview:
Nestled in the heart of San Francisco's bustling tech scene, our innovative digital agency CreativePunch is seeking a Creative Technologist who blends artistry with programming prowess. This is not just a job; it's an invitation to reshape the digital landscape.

Who Are You?
You're a dreamer and a doer, someone who looks at code and sees a canvas. You're not confined by boundaries - geographical or technological. You thrive in environments where your creativity can run wild, and you're as comfortable with an artist's paintbrush as you are with a coder's keyboard.

What You'll Do:
In a typical day, you might find yourself brainstorming with our design team in a sunlit, plant-filled office overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. Post-lunch, you'll dive into developing an interactive installation that marries touch-sensitive surfaces with immersive audio-visual experiences. As the sun sets, you'll wrap up by prototyping an AR app that brings storybook characters to life.

Skills Needed:

Expertise in a variety of programming languages (JavaScript, Python, C++) and a passion for learning new ones.
A keen eye for design and a heart that beats for user experience.
Experience in AR/VR development or a strong desire to learn.
A knack for problem-solving and a love for technical challenges.
Education & Experience:

A bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Digital Arts, or a related field is ideal but not mandatory. We value skill and passion as much as degrees.
At least 3 years of experience in a creative technology role, whether in an agency, as a freelancer, or in an equally dynamic setting.
Why Join Us?
You'll be joining a team of thinkers, artists, and technologists who believe in the power of technology to transform and inspire. Our office is a playground for the imagination, equipped with the latest gadgets and an atmosphere that encourages experimentation.

Perks:

Competitive salary of $100,000 per year with performance bonuses.
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance.
Flexible work hours and remote work options.
Annual education stipend for courses, conferences, or workshops of your choice.
How to Apply:
Send us your resume, a cover letter that tells your story, and a portfolio that showcases your best work. We're not just looking for a list of skills â€“ we want to see the magic you've created.

Join us in our journey to blend art and technology, and help us create experiences that touch hearts and minds.
